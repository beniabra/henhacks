## Inspiration
Looking at the hack categories we chose to make a platform that would support the Delaware community and specifically match underserved communities in Delaware to alternative financial resources based on their needs.

## What it does
Our website works as a financial resource matching platform. Users can input their financial needs whether it be healthcare, food, or housing and MoneyMatch will match them with the best available financial resources in their area. This platform also has a discussion forum where users can talk to each other about what financial resources have helped them. 

## How we built it
We used Django as our backend framework and Python to connect our database (SQLite3). We used HTML and CSS as well as Bootstrap on our frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
Working with Django queries to perform our matches was difficult as we initially wanted users to be able to select multiple areas where they would need help, but we couldn't figure out the best way to filter results with multiple categories. We ended up having the user choose only one category to search.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how we got the website and the resources matching portion to work. We tried to prioritize the aesthetic of the website and we love how the website looks. For the limited amount of time we had, we're proud of how well it came together. 

## What we learned
We were both pretty new to Django, so we learned a lot about what it takes to make a website in Django and incorporating our frontend with our backend.

## What's next for Money Match
We want to add additional features like a savings calculator and interactive budgeting tools. We also want to develop our discussion form to add the ability to reply to comments on the discussion forum as it is currently static.
